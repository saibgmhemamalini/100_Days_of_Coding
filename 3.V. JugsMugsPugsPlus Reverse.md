# Write a program that receives a number on the input.
It also should receive another boolean value 'rev' on the input. 

  - If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs". 
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".

  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugPugs".
        - also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"

Otherwise, it prints the number.
