# If you adopted the "Follow the Left Wall" algorithm, you will complete Level 10. 
What is the JavaScript code you got? 
How many blocks did you have left? 
Assign it to the variable remaining_blocks.

``` level_10_code = '''while (notDone()) {
  if (isPathLeft()) {
    turnLeft();
  }
  if (isPathForward()) {
    moveForward();
  } else {
    turnRight();
  }
}
remaining_blocks = '''4'''
print("JavaScript code for Level 10")
print(level_10_code)
print("Number of blocks remaining", remaining_blocks)```
